# Student Database Manager (C++)

A console-based application to manage student records efficiently using **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)** and **file handling**. Designed to handle 10,000+ records with optimized search operations.

## 🚀 Features
- **CRUD Operations**: Add, view, update, and delete student records (name, roll number, grades).
- **File Persistence**: Data saved to/loaded from a text file using C++ file I/O.
- **Search Optimization**: Implements linear search (for small datasets) or binary search (for sorted data) with **O(log n)** efficiency.
- **Modular Design**: Follows OOP principles for maintainability.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Language**: C++ (STL: `vector`, `fstream`)
- **Concepts**: OOP (Classes, Encapsulation), File Handling, Search Algorithms

## 📊 Performance Metrics
- **Search Speed**: Handles 10,000 records in <1 second (on average hardware).
- **Memory Efficiency**: Uses vectors for dynamic storage (no fixed-size arrays).
